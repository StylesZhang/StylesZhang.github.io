I am a first-year PhD student in the HKU Musketeers Foundation Institute of Data Science [(HKU-IDS)](https://datascience.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Yanchao Yang](https://yanchaoyang.github.io/) and co-advised by [Prof. Yi Ma](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/). Undergraduate studies from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Computer Science.

My research interest lies in building embodied agents by learning from natural signals. I aim to create human-like intelligence while enhancing our understanding of human brains. I am also interested in neuroscience and cognitive science.

My recent research focus is 3D representation learning related to the manifold, namely, the perception of agents.
